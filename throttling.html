<!--

  Throttling the execution of scripts attached to "scroll" DOM events. Drastically reduces load on JS engine, as scroll events 
  can trigger many times on one scroll, E.G on mobile. Throttling limits the amount of times the event can trigger per a set time.
  
  The below combines the throttling concept, with an API that allow elements to be slide on when they are in the window "view" (scroll).

-->
<script>

function callbackFunc(){
  //check if some divs are in view, bring them into view with CSS animations.
  if () {
    // add css aimations to move in.
  }
}

function test(){
  // call the function ever 100 miliseconds (0.1 secs) to throttle scroll event.
  setInterval(callbackFunc, 100);
};

//get all elements with classname, use ES6 spread (...) to convert to array, then loop through adding event listener to each.
var ele = [...document.querySelectorAll(".waiting")];
ele.forEach(item => { item.addEventListener("scroll", test); } );

</script>
